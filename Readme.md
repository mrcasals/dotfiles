# My dotfiles

## Installation

Note you'll need Ruby in order to install these dotfiles.

  git clone git://github.com/mrcasals/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install

## Using your own config along

These dotfiles require this file:

  ~/.zshrc.local

Here you can add your own mapping without risking to lose them when updating the repo :)

Have fun! :)
